## 🚀 Buat Tabel di DynamoDB

![dynamo](https://github.com/mohlutfifadilah/aws-dynamoDB/blob/master/path-to-your-image.png)

In this tutorial, we'll embark on a thrilling journey of Big Data and Cloud Computing using AWS services. DynamoDB will be our trusted NoSQL database, while S3 will provide storage power. We'll leverage the incredible capabilities of AWS Lambda functions to process and analyze data. Let's unleash the true potential of the cloud! ☁️

## ✨ Prerequisites

To embark on this adventure, make sure you have the following:

- An AWS account with the necessary permissions. 🌐
- Basic knowledge of AWS services, including DynamoDB, S3, and Lambda. 🧠
- Familiarity with Python programming. 🐍

## 🎉 Getting Started

To begin our quest, let's follow these steps:

1. Login to the AWS Console using your own account credentials. 🔑
2. Navigate to the Database section and choose DynamoDB. 🗄️
3. Create a new table with the desired schema. ⚙️
4. Wait for the table to become active. ⏳
5. Enter the "profile" table and create a new item with your own data. ✏️

For detailed instructions and helpful screenshots, refer to the [🎉 Getting Started](#-getting-started) section of this tutorial.

## 📥 Importing Data

In this section, we'll import data into DynamoDB using a CSV file. Let's dive in:

1. Create an S3 bucket to store the CSV file. 📦
2. Upload the CSV file to the S3 bucket. 🚀
3. Set up an IAM role and Lambda function to access DynamoDB and S3 services. 🛠️
4. Configure the Lambda function with the provided code. ⌨️
5. Test the Lambda function to import the data into DynamoDB. 🧪

For a step-by-step guide and helpful code snippets, refer to the [📥 Importing Data](#-importing-data) section of this tutorial.

## 💡 Working with DynamoDB

Now that our data is imported, let's unleash the power of DynamoDB! We'll perform various operations, including querying, updating, and deleting items. Additionally, we'll learn how to create filters to retrieve specific data based on conditions. 🗃️

To become a DynamoDB master, head over to the [💡 Working with DynamoDB](#-working-with-dynamodb) section of this tutorial.

## 🔍 Creating Filters

Filters allow us to dive deep into our data and retrieve only what we need. In this section, we'll uncover the secrets of creating filters to fetch relevant data from the DynamoDB table. Let's sharpen our query skills! 🔍

To unravel the mysteries of creating filters, refer to the [🔍 Creating Filters](#-creating-filters) section of this tutorial.

## 📤 Exporting Data

Sharing is caring! Exporting data from DynamoDB opens up endless possibilities, from backups to advanced analysis. Let's learn how to export data to different formats and take our insights to new heights. 📈

For a comprehensive guide on exporting data from DynamoDB, check out the [📤 Exporting Data](#-exporting-data) section of this tutorial.

## 🎓 Conclusion

Congratulations on conquering the Big Data and Cloud Computing Practicum! You've unlocked the secrets of DynamoDB, S3, and Lambda, empowering yourself with the skills needed to tackle Big Data challenges in the cloud. Your journey has just begun! 🚀
